# vfo-discord-bot

Discord bot created for [Vampire's Fall: Origins](https://www.reddit.com/r/vampiresfallorigins/) community

### How do I run it?

#### Prequisities
* npm and node (see the introduction [here](https://www.w3schools.com/nodejs/nodejs_npm.asp), you can download it directly [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/))
* secret token (create your own bot token for testing purposes, follow [this](https://discordjs.guide/preparations/setting-up-a-bot-application.html#creating-your-bot) guide)

Then issue the following commands into the terminal:
```
git clone <this repo link>
cd vfo-discord-bot
npm i
token=<insert your token here>
npm start
```

if you're using windows, replace 
`token=<insert your token here>`
with 
`set token "<insert your token here>"`.
It should work although I haven't tested it.
